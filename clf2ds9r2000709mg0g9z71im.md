A few months ago I tried AdonisJS and miraculously he was able to make me comfortable, which is offered, like Laravel but in a Node.js environment.

During this period of approach (Taaruf in Islam), I found a lot of cool new things, before that I made a package for Node.js and I'm interested in making a package for AdonisJS.

And it so happened that I was working on a project which also happened to be the base project AdonisJS, so all I had to do was create a package to integrate with the WhatsApp Cloud API.

Let's get started, make sure you have registered yourself as a Meta Developer here, then don't forget to activate two-factor authentication. You can see it in full on the [official page here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started).

## Setup

To start with setup, we need to install first, the package I have published.

```bash
npm i adonisjs-whatsapp
# or
yarn add adonisjs-whatsapp
```

Then run the configuration command to apply some of the existing requirements.

```bash
node ace configure adonisjs-whatsapp
```

After executing the command above, it will create several files including `config/whatsapp.ts`, you can customize them.

```typescript
// config/whatsapp.ts
import Env from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Env'
import { WhatsAppConfig } from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/WhatsApp'

const whatsappConfig: WhatsAppConfig = {
  webhookRoute: '/webhook/whatsapp',
  timeout: 60_000,
  phoneNumberId: Env.get('WABA_ID'),
  accessToken: Env.get('WABA_TOKEN'),
  verifyToken: Env.get('WABA_VERIFY'),
  graphUrl: 'https://graph.facebook.com',
  graphVersion: 'v16.0',
}

export default whatsappConfig
```

Most importantly, you have to adjust the value of the environment variables that have been created, including the following.

```bash
WABA_ID=
WABA_TOKEN=
WABA_VERIFY=
```

And don't forget to add the following lines to the `env.ts` file.

```typescript
WABA_ID: Env.schema.number(),
WABA_TOKEN: Env.schema.string(),
WABA_VERIFY: Env.schema.string(),
```

## Usages

It's very easy to set up, just a few steps, then we'll go to its use. Let's open the `start/whatsapp.ts` file.

```typescript
// start/whatsapp.ts

import WhatsApp from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/WhatsApp'

WhatsApp.on('message:text', (message) => {
    // listen to text messages
})
```

Events currently supported include the following: `message:text`, `message:image`, `message:document`, `message:audio`, `message:video`, `message:sticker`, `message:location`, `message:contacts`, `message:button` and `message:list`.

To listen to everything (without being specific), you can use an asterisk. This for example:

```typescript
// start/whatsapp.ts

import WhatsApp from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/WhatsApp'

WhatsApp.on('message:*', (message) => {
    // listen to any messages
})
```

The `message` variable we are sending (callback) is an object, I'll give you an example, you can see the [type here](https://github.com/sooluh/adonisjs-whatsapp/blob/main/adonis-typings/whatsapp.ts#L142).

```typescript
{
    "from": 6281234567890,
    "sender": "People",
    "wamid": "wamid.xxxx",
    "data": {
        "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
    },
    "timestamp": 1678440781,
    "type": "text"
}
```

For other types of messages, it's more or less the same, only the body part might be different. For more details, we can refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/payload-examples) of Meta, from the documentation, on the data object I cast `entry[0].changes[0].value.messages[0]` and enter the message type, if `text` then `entry[0].changes[0].value.messages[0].text` and so on.

To listen to the status of a message, whether sent, received or read, you can use the `status:sent`, `status:delivered` and `status:read` events, then in the callback, I send variables like the following:

```typescript
// start/whatsapp.ts

import WhatsApp from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/WhatsApp'

WhatsApp.on('status:*', (message) => {
    // {"from": 6281234567890, "wamid": "wamid.xxxxx", "timestamp": 1678440781, "status": "read"}
})
```

To send messages or reply to messages, you still use the same singleton. You can call it from the preload file (in this case `start/whatsapp.ts` or something else), or via the controller.

```typescript
// app/Controllers/Http/ExampleController.ts

import WhatsApp from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/WhatsApp'
import { HttpContextContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/HttpContext'

export default class ExampleController {
  public async example(ctx: HttpContextContract) {
    const { message } = ctx.request.only(['message'])
    await WhatsApp.sendText(6281234567890, message)
    return { success: true }
  }
}
```

Everything is in the autocomplete, so for sending images you can use the `sendImage` method, for sending documents using `sendDocument` and so on, with the parameters I have set.

Maybe that's all if there is something you want to ask, please submit it in the comments, and if there are problems, you can open an [issue in this repository](https://github.com/sooluh/adonisjs-whatsapp/issues). Thanks!
